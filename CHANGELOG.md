# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

<!-- Conventions.

     Headings are the six Keep a Changelog sections only: Added, Changed,
     Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security. There is no "Breaking" heading and
     no "Fixed (spec compliance)" heading.

     A breaking change goes under Changed or Removed, with the bullet prefixed
     "**BREAKING**: ".

     A fix that came out of the OpenTelemetry specification compliance audit
     goes under Fixed and names the spec document and requirement level in the
     entry itself, for example "which logs/api.md makes a MUST". That citation
     is what records the provenance now that the heading is gone, so do not
     drop it. The audit findings are tracked under the spec-compliance label.

## [1.0.0-rc.4-wip]

### Added

- `APIMeter.registerBatchCallback(callback, instruments)` registers one callback
  that observes several instruments at once and returns an
  `APIBatchCallbackRegistration` with `unregister()`. Instruments must belong
  to the same meter, per metrics/api.md ([#113](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/113)).
- `InstrumentAdvisory` on all seven `APIMeter.create*` methods, carrying
  `explicitBucketBoundaries` and `attributeKeys` hints to the SDK
  ([#113](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/113)).
- `APIObservableInstrument`, implemented by the three observable instruments,
  so batch callbacks and `registerBatchCallback` take a real type
  ([#113](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/113)).
- `createObservableCounter`, `createObservableUpDownCounter` and
  `createObservableGauge` accept a `callbacks` list, and the instruments gain
  `addCallback`, which returns a registration handle, and `removeCallback`
  ([#113](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/113)).
- `APITracer.startSpan` and `APITracer.createSpan` now accept a `root: true`
  parameter to force the creation of a root span, even when a parent span is
  active in the context
  ([#118](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/118)).
- `APITracer.startSpan` now accepts an optional `startTime` parameter
  ([#118](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/118)).

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: `parentSpan` and `spanContext` parameters have been removed from
  `APITracer.startSpan` and `APITracer.createSpan`. Span creation now always
  uses the parent span or remote context stored in the provided `Context` (or
  `Context.current` if omitted). `parentSpan: parent` becomes
  `context: Context.current.withSpan(parent)`. `spanContext: sc` has no direct
  replacement: it assigned `sc` to the new span verbatim, span ID included,
  which the specification's Span Creation section does not provide for. Putting
  `sc` on the `Context` instead makes the new span a *child* of it — a new span
  ID, with `parentSpanId` set to `sc.spanId`. Callers who actually wanted a span
  carrying `sc` unchanged should use `OTelAPI.nonRecordingSpan(sc)`.
  The full parent precedence is `root` > remote `SpanContext` > local `Span` >
  valid non-remote `SpanContext` > new root, applied identically with and
  without an SDK installed. A candidate whose `SpanContext` is invalid is
  skipped, so a `Context` carrying only an invalid span or span context yields
  a root span rather than an error. When a remote `SpanContext` identifies a
  `Span` in the same `Context`, that `Span` is kept as the new span's
  `parentSpan`
  ([#118](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/118)).
- **BREAKING**: `Baggage.getAllValues()` now returns
  `Map<String, BaggageEntry>` instead of `List<String>`, the name/value pairs
  the specification's "Get All Values" operation requires. To get the old
  `List<String>` back, write
  `getAllValues().values.map((e) => e.value).toList()`.
  `Baggage.getAllEntries()` is now `@Deprecated` and delegates to
  `getAllValues()`; it will be removed in a future release
  ([#127](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/127)).
- **BREAKING**: `APIMeterProvider` holds no configuration or operational
  state, per metrics/noop.md. The `endpoint`, `serviceName`, `serviceVersion`,
  `enabled` and `isShutdown` getters and setters are removed, `getMeter`
  returns a fresh no-op meter each call, and `shutdown` and `forceFlush`
  always return `true` ([#113](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/113)).

### Deprecated

- The `boundaries` parameter on `createHistogram`. Use
  `advisory: InstrumentAdvisory(explicitBucketBoundaries: ...)`. When both are
  given, `boundaries` wins so existing callers keep their buckets, and the rest
  of the advisory is kept ([#113](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/113)).
- The `callback` parameter on the three `createObservable*` methods. Use the
  `callbacks` list; a `callback` is prepended to it ([#113](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/113)).

### Removed

- **BREAKING**: the `parentSpan` and `spanContext` parameters of
  `APITracer.startSpan` and `APITracer.createSpan`. The parent now comes from
  the `Context`, so `parentSpan: parent` becomes
  `context: Context.current.withSpan(parent)`. `spanContext: sc` has no
  equivalent, because it gave the new span `sc` verbatim, span ID included.
  Put `sc` on the `Context` to parent a new span to it, or use
  `OTelAPI.nonRecordingSpan(sc)` to wrap it unchanged. The `startSpan` dartdoc
  documents the full parent precedence
  ([#118](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/118)).
- **BREAKING**: `Context.copyWithValue`. It generated a key the caller could never
  get back, so a value stored through it was unreachable. Create the key with
  `OTelAPI.contextKey<T>(name)` and use `Context.copyWith(key, value)`
  ([#130](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/130)).

### Fixed

- `IdGenerator` no longer draws every ID byte from a fresh
  `Random.secure().nextInt(256)` call (one OS entropy syscall per byte), which
  made generating a span ID cost ~330 µs and a trace ID ~665 µs on macOS arm64 —
  roughly 1 ms to start a root span. It now seeds a xorshift128 generator once
  from the OS CSPRNG and expands it locally (~18,000–21,000× faster), keeping
  the same 8/16-byte, non-zero, unique-ID contract, with 32-bit-masked
  arithmetic so VM and web builds produce identical sequences. Note that a
  locally generated trace ID exposes the full generator state, so subsequent
  IDs from the same isolate are predictable — generated IDs must not be used
  as secrets or security tokens
  ([#144](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/144)).
- `TraceState` construction (`fromMap`, `OTelAPI`/`OTelFactory` `traceState(...)`)
  now validates keys and values against the W3C tracestate grammar, dropping
  invalid entries instead of silently accepting them
  ([#119](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/119)).
- **BREAKING**: `IdGenerator.hexToBytes`, and so `OTelAPI.traceIdFrom` and
  `OTelAPI.spanIdFrom`, no longer accept anything outside lowercase hex
  ([#112](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/112)).
- `APISpan.addLink` and `APISpan.addSpanLink` now document that a link given at
  span creation is preferred to a later call. The trace/api.md spec makes this
  a MUST, because head sampling can only use the information present at span
  creation. Comments only, no behavior change
  ([#133](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/133)).
- The trace API now documents that `APITracerProvider`, `APITracer` and
  `APISpan` implementations need to be safe for concurrent use, which
  trace/api.md makes a MUST. Comments only, no behavior change
  ([#120](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/120)).
- The logs API now documents that `APILoggerProvider` and `APILogger`
  implementations need to be safe for concurrent use, which logs/api.md makes
  a MUST. Comments only, no behavior change
  ([#121](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/121)).
- Span events with an empty name are dropped and reported to `OTelErrorHandler`.
  `OTelAPI.spanEvent('')`, `addEvent`, `addEventNow` and `addEvents` no longer
  throw an `ArgumentError`, per error-handling.md
  ([#117](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/117)).
- Empty string and empty array attribute values no longer throw `ArgumentError`
  ([#103](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/103)).
- Typed `Attributes` getters return null on a type mismatch instead of throwing
  `StateError`, and report it through the error handler
  ([#106](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/106)).
- `APISpan` honors the `isRecording` value given at creation, so mutating
  operations on a non-recording span are no-ops
  ([#124](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/124)).
- `APITracer.isEnabled()` no longer always returns `false`. It reports whether
  a real SDK factory is installed, so honoring `isRecording` no longer makes
  every span non-recording
  ([#124](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/124)).
- `TraceState.put` now moves a new or updated key to the front of the
  entries, per the W3C Trace Context rules for mutating `tracestate`. This
  also fixes overflow trimming, which evicted the newest entry instead of
  the oldest.
  ([#115](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/115))

- `TraceState.fromString` keeps only the first entry when a key repeats, which
  W3C Trace Context allows one of. A list member with an invalid key or value is
  now reported to the error handler instead of being dropped silently. An empty
  list member and a whitespace-only list member are dropped without a report,
  because the W3C grammar allows them
  ([#116](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/116)).
- Without an SDK, `createSpan` returns the parent span directly when it is already
  non-recording instead of wrapping it again, per trace/api.md
  ([#129](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/129)).
- `APITracer` builds its `InstrumentationScope` once, from the tracer's own name,
  version, schema URL and attributes. Span attributes no longer leak into the
  scope, and no version is invented ([#129](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/129)).

## [1.0.0-rc.3] - 2026-08-27

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: `enabled` becomes `isEnabled()` on `APITracer`, `APILogger`,
  `APIInstrument` and all instruments, and the `enabled` constructor parameter
  is removed. Replace `x.enabled` with `x.isEnabled()`.
  `APILogger.isEnabled()` now accepts `Context`, `SeverityNumber` and
  `EventName`. The provider-level `enabled` getters are unchanged.
  ([#105](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/105))
- **BREAKING**: `getTracer`, `getLogger` and `getMeter` no longer invent a
  scope version or schema URL. Omit them and `version` and `schemaUrl` are now
  `null`, rather than this package's own version and a schema URL your library
  never declared. Spans no longer carry a fabricated `1.0.0` scope version.
  ([#108](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/108))

## [0.11.0] - 2026-08-27

Stable-channel republication of `1.0.0-rc.3`. The code is the rc's code with a
stable version stamp, so users who have not opted into prereleases get the
fixes. See the `1.0.0-rc.3` entry for detail. The changes listed below are the
delta against `0.10.0`, the previous stable release, not against the previous
prerelease.

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: `enabled` is now `isEnabled()` on tracers, loggers and
  instruments, and the `enabled` constructor parameter is removed. Replace
  `x.enabled` with `x.isEnabled()`.
  ([#105](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/105))
- **BREAKING**: `getTracer`, `getLogger` and `getMeter` no longer invent a
  scope version or schema URL. Both are `null` when you omit them.
  ([#108](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/108))

## [1.0.0-rc.2] - 2026-08-23

### Added
- **`OTelAPI.setErrorHandler`, a user-configurable global error handler**
  ([api#102](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/102)). Internal misuse reports route through it instead of throwing;
  the default handler logs via `OTelLog` and never throws. A user-installed
  handler that throws propagates deliberately (strict mode), per
  error-handling.md. The handler is factory-held state: `OTelFactory`
  carries the installed handler and an overridable `defaultErrorHandler`
  for SDK factories, and a handler installed before any factory exists
  is buffered and adopted at factory installation. `Context.runIsolate`
  re-installs the parent's handler inside the child isolate (handlers
  are copied; capture a `SendPort` to aggregate reports across isolates,
  an unsendable handler degrades to the child default and is
  reported).

### Fixed
- **`Span.end()` no longer promotes status from Unset to Ok** ([api#102](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/102)).
  `Unset` stays `Unset`; analysis tools can no longer be misled by
  fabricated Ok statuses. The deprecated `spanStatus` parameter still
  flows through the `setStatus` rules when passed.
- **`CompositePropagator.extract` walks propagators in the order they were
  specified** ([api#102](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/102)), matching inject and every other OpenTelemetry SDK
  (was reversed, so the last-registered propagator no longer wins extract).
- **`Context.withSpanContext` returns a derived Context instead of throwing
  `ArgumentError`** when the context already holds a span from a different
  trace ([api#102](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/102)), a routine situation during extraction.

### Added
- **Semantic conventions regenerated from registry v1.44.0** (previously
  v1.43.0-21-g436fa257). Additive only, per the VERSIONING.md policy: 47
  new identifiers, no renames and no removals.

  The substantial addition is the complete **`browser.web_vital.*`** set,
  `name`, `value`, `delta`, `id`, `rating` and `navigation_type`, together
  with their value enums: `cls`, `lcp`, `fcp`, `inp`, `ttfb` and the
  obsoleted `fid`; `good` / `needs-improvement` / `poor`; and the six
  navigation types (`navigate`, `reload`, `back-forward`,
  `back-forward-cache`, `prerender`, `restore`). Web-vitals instrumentation
  now has registry names to emit against instead of inventing its own.

  Also new: `browser.platform`, `hw.errors` and `hw.status`,
  `k8s.node.filesystem.inode.count` / `.free`, and the `scaleway_cloud`
  and `scaleway_cloud_compute` members.

- **`lib/src/api/semantics/candidates/`, a home for attribute keys that are
  not yet in the registry**, staged for upstream contribution, exported from
  the package barrel and marked `@experimental`.

  rc.1 removed a private dialect masquerading as OpenTelemetry, which was
  right, but left nowhere to stage conventions we want to propose upstream.
  A separate directory under a separate stability promise keeps published
  conventions distinguishable from proposals.

  Candidates are **unstable in identity but deprecation-cycled**: a renamed or
  rejected candidate is `@Deprecated`, pointing at its replacement, for one
  release before removal. Accepted upstream, it reappears in generated
  `semconv/` output and the candidate is deprecated in its favor.

  Staged: `app.start.type` (`cold`/`warm`/`hot`), `app.launch.id`,
  `app.screen.previous_id`, `app.screen.previous_name`,
  `app.gesture.direction`, `app.gesture.delta.x`, `app.gesture.delta.y`,
  `device.battery.level`, `device.battery.state`, `device.battery.save_mode`,
  `device.emulator`, and `browser.languages`.

- **`doc/SEMCONV_CANDIDATES.md`**, the disposition of all 116 identifiers
  removed in rc.1. Most should return as *registry* conventions rather than
  candidates: the registry has since gained `app.crash`, `app.jank`,
  `app.screen.click`, `app.widget.click`, `device.app.lifecycle`,
  `session.start`/`session.end` and `browser.web_vital.*`, which cover the
  bulk of the removed RUM surface. The document maps each removal to its
  registry replacement, to a candidate, or to a recorded reason for dropping
  it.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-23

Stable-channel republication of `1.0.0-rc.2`. The first stable-channel
release since `0.9.1`. The code is the rc's code with a stable version
stamp, so users who have not opted into prereleases get the fixes. See
the `1.0.0-beta.*` through `1.0.0-rc.2` entries for the complete history
since `0.9.1`. The changes listed below are the delta against `0.9.1`,
the previous stable release, not against the previous prerelease.

The highlights, for anyone coming from `0.9.1`:

- **`OTelAPI.setErrorHandler`**. Configure where the library's internal
  error reports go. The default logs and never throws; a strict handler
  can crash-fast in development; `Context.runIsolate` carries the
  handler into child isolates.
- **Spec-compliance fixes**: `Span.end()` no longer fabricates an `Ok`
  status, `CompositePropagator.extract` runs in registration order, and
  `Context.withSpanContext` derives instead of throwing.
- **Semantic conventions at registry v1.44.0**, including the complete
  `browser.web_vital.*` set, plus an `@experimental` `candidates/`
  staging area for keys proposed upstream.

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Everything the rc line changed applies here, most notably
  `1.0.0-rc.1`'s removal of 116 vendor/RUM identifiers that were not
  OpenTelemetry semantic conventions. `doc/SEMCONV_CANDIDATES.md` maps
  every removal to its registry replacement, a staged candidate, or a
  recorded reason for dropping it.

## [1.0.0-rc.1] - 2026-07-18

### Removed
- **Breaking: the deprecated vendor/RUM enums are removed** (deprecated
  with notice in 1.0.0-beta.10): `AppLifecycleStates`,
  `AppLifecycleSemantics`, `AppStartType`, `AppInfoSemantics`,
  `DeviceSemantics`, `BatterySemantics`, `NavigationSemantics`,
  `InteractionType`, `InteractionSemantics`, `PerformanceSemantics`,
  `ErrorSemantics`, `NetworkSemantics`, `RumSessionView`,
  `NavigationAction`, and `LifecycleState` (`semantics/rum.dart` is
  gone). They are not OpenTelemetry semantic conventions and so do not
  belong in this package; `flutterrific_opentelemetry` defines its own
  Flutter conventions for what the registry does not yet cover. The API
  package now contains only registry conventions.

### Added
- **Semantic-conventions versioning policy** in VERSIONING.md: within a
  major version, registry regenerations are additive and deprecating
  only; identifier- or wire-affecting registry changes batch into the
  next major; spec-fidelity string corrections are bug fixes with a
  CHANGELOG wire-format table.

### Changed
- **Breaking: `APIObservableResult` is now an abstract interface.** The
  API-side implementation was unconstructible (private constructor, no
  factory) so nothing could have used it; SDKs implement the interface,
  as `dartastic_opentelemetry` already does.

### Fixed
- `Attributes.of` no longer throws a `TypeError` when a map value is an
  untyped list (`List<Object>` / `List<dynamic>`). Lists are now
  element-checked like `Attributes.fromJson`: homogeneous
  string/bool/int/double lists convert, mixed numeric lists promote to
  `List<double>`, and unsupported element types are warned and ignored
  per the OTel specification.

## [1.0.0-beta.10] - 2026-07-18

### Changed

- **`*Create` classes are now `@internal` and hidden from the public library.**
  They were internal by doc-comment convention only; the barrel exported them,
  so `AttributesCreate.create()` etc. were callable by any consumer, an open
  factory-bypass door, contradicting the beta.8/9 removal of factory cheat
  paths. The analyzer now rejects outside-package use
  (`invalid_use_of_internal_member`). Factories and same-package code are
  unaffected. Consumers constructing objects must go through `OTelAPI` or the
  installed `OTelFactory`. Covers all 29 `*Create` classes, including the
  new `CompositePropagatorCreate`.

- **Breaking: the semantic-convention enums are now generated from the
  OpenTelemetry registry with OTel Weaver, one file per registry
  namespace** ([#52](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/52)). The hand-written `semantics.dart`,
  `semantic_values.dart`, `semantic_metrics.dart`, `semantic_events.dart`,
  `gen_ai_semantics.dart`, and `ui_semantics.dart` are gone; generated
  files live under `lib/src/api/semantics/semconv/` (90 attribute
  namespaces, 931 attributes, 167 value enums, 29 metric namespaces with
  533 metrics, 14 event namespaces with 32 events, and 24 entity
  namespaces with 64 entities). Generated from
  [semantic-conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions)
  `v1.43.0-21-g436fa257` (commit `436fa257`, schema `1.44.0-unreleased`).
  Regenerate with `tool/semconv/generate.sh`; verify freshness with
  `tool/semconv/generate.sh --check`. There is no compatibility layer.
  The tables below are the migration guide.

- **Breaking: file restructure.** Every old semantics file is replaced:

  | Old file | Replacement |
  | --- | --- |
  | `semantics/semantics.dart` | `semantics/semantics_base.dart` (interfaces) + `semantics/semconv/<ns>.dart` per namespace + `semantics/http_header_attribute.dart` |
  | `semantics/semantic_values.dart` | value enums live beside their attribute in `semconv/<ns>.dart` |
  | `semantics/semantic_metrics.dart` | `semconv/metrics/<ns>_metrics.dart` per namespace |
  | `semantics/semantic_events.dart` | `semconv/events/<ns>_events.dart` per namespace |
  | `semantics/gen_ai_semantics.dart` | `semconv/gen_ai.dart` (wholly deprecated, see below) |
  | `semantics/ui_semantics.dart` | `semantics/rum.dart` (wholly deprecated, see below) |
  | `semantics/navigation_action.dart` | `semantics/rum.dart` |
  | `semantics/lifecycle_state.dart` | `semantics/rum.dart` |

- **Breaking: attribute-key enums are named after their registry
  namespace**, with an `Attributes` suffix only where the bare name
  collides with `dart:core`/`dart:io`/Flutter-widgets types. Renames
  (everything not listed keeps its name and is regenerated in place):

  | Old enum | New enum |
  | --- | --- |
  | `Database` | `Db` |
  | `Kubernetes` | `K8s` |
  | `Hardware` | `Hw` (all keys change too, see Fixed) |
  | `OperatingSystem` | `Os` |
  | `RPC` | `Rpc` |
  | `GraphQL` | `Graphql` |
  | `CloudEvents` | `Cloudevents` |
  | `ComputeUnit` | `ContainerAttributes` |
  | `ErrorResource` | `ErrorAttributes` |
  | `EventResource` | `EventAttributes` |
  | `ExceptionResource` | `ExceptionAttributes` |
  | `FileResource` | `FileAttributes` |
  | `ProcessResource` | `ProcessAttributes` |
  | `ServerResource` | `Server` |
  | `TelemetrySDK`, `TelemetryDistro` | `Telemetry` (merged) |
  | `ComputeInstance` | merged into `Host` (same member names) |
  | `SourceCode` | merged into `Code` (same member names) |
  | `GenAI`, `GenAi` | `GenAi` (merged, deprecated, see below) |
  | `Environment` | `Deployment.deploymentEnvironment` (`@Deprecated`) |
  | `General` | split: `Service.serviceName`/`serviceVersion`, `Telemetry.telemetrySdk*` |
  | `Version` | removed (see Removed) |

- **Breaking: member identifiers are the camelCase of the full attribute
  id** (tokens split on `.`/`_`; single registry tokens keep their
  casing, e.g. `replicaset`, `cloudevents`, `launchtype`). Key strings
  are unchanged unless listed under Fixed. Renamed members:

  `Http`:

  | Old | New |
  | --- | --- |
  | `requestMethod` | `httpRequestMethod` |
  | `requestMethodOriginal` | `httpRequestMethodOriginal` |
  | `requestResendCount` | `httpRequestResendCount` |
  | `responseStatusCode` | `httpResponseStatusCode` |
  | `requestSize` | `httpRequestSize` |
  | `requestBodySize` | `httpRequestBodySize` |
  | `responseSize` | `httpResponseSize` |
  | `responseBodySize` | `httpResponseBodySize` |

  `GenAi` (every member also `@Deprecated`, see below):

  | Old | New |
  | --- | --- |
  | `system` | `genAiSystem` |
  | `operationName` | `genAiOperationName` |
  | `requestModel` | `genAiRequestModel` |
  | `requestMaxTokens` | `genAiRequestMaxTokens` |
  | `requestTemperature` | `genAiRequestTemperature` |
  | `requestTopP` | `genAiRequestTopP` |
  | `requestTopK` | `genAiRequestTopK` |
  | `requestFrequencyPenalty` | `genAiRequestFrequencyPenalty` |
  | `requestPresencePenalty` | `genAiRequestPresencePenalty` |
  | `requestStopSequences` | `genAiRequestStopSequences` |
  | `responseId` | `genAiResponseId` |
  | `responseModel` | `genAiResponseModel` |
  | `responseFinishReasons` | `genAiResponseFinishReasons` |
  | `usageInputTokens` | `genAiUsageInputTokens` |
  | `usageOutputTokens` | `genAiUsageOutputTokens` |

  `Kubernetes` → `K8s` (single-token registry words):

  | Old | New |
  | --- | --- |
  | `k8sReplicaSetUid` / `k8sReplicaSetName` | `k8sReplicasetUid` / `k8sReplicasetName` |
  | `k8sStatefulSetUid` / `k8sStatefulSetName` | `k8sStatefulsetUid` / `k8sStatefulsetName` |
  | `k8sDaemonSetUid` / `k8sDaemonSetName` | `k8sDaemonsetUid` / `k8sDaemonsetName` |
  | `k8sCronJobUid` / `k8sCronJobName` | `k8sCronjobUid` / `k8sCronjobName` |

  `Hardware` → `Hw`: `hardwareId` → `hwId`, `hardwareName` → `hwName`,
  `hardwareParent` → `hwParent`, `hardwareSerialNumber` →
  `hwSerialNumber`, `hardwareType` → `hwType`, `hardwareVendor` →
  `hwVendor`, `hardwareModel` → `hwModel` (key strings change too, see
  Fixed).

  `CloudEvents` → `Cloudevents`: `cloudEventsEventId` →
  `cloudeventsEventId`, `cloudEventsEventSource` →
  `cloudeventsEventSource`, `cloudEventsEventSpecVersion` →
  `cloudeventsEventSpecVersion`, `cloudEventsEventSubject` →
  `cloudeventsEventSubject`, `cloudEventsEventType` →
  `cloudeventsEventType`.

  `TelemetrySDK`/`TelemetryDistro` → `Telemetry`: `sdkName` →
  `telemetrySdkName`, `sdkLanguage` → `telemetrySdkLanguage`,
  `sdkVersion` → `telemetrySdkVersion`, `distroName` →
  `telemetryDistroName`, `distroVersion` → `telemetryDistroVersion`.

  `Aws`: `awsEcsLaunchType` → `awsEcsLaunchtype`.

  All other attribute-key enums already followed the rule. Their
  members are unchanged.

- **Breaking: metric enum members follow the same rule**, camelCase of
  the full metric name instead of the old namespace-stripped short form.
  Every member of the 15 pre-existing metric enums gains its namespace
  prefix; the old name was exactly the new name minus that prefix (e.g.
  `CicdMetric.pipelineRunActive` → `CicdMetric.cicdPipelineRunActive`,
  `HttpMetric.serverRequestDuration` →
  `HttpMetric.httpServerRequestDuration`, `K8sMetric.podCpuUsage` →
  `K8sMetric.k8sPodCpuUsage`).

- **Breaking: `SemanticEvent` split into per-namespace event enums**
  implementing the unchanged `OTelEvent` interface:

  | Old `SemanticEvent` member | New |
  | --- | --- |
  | `exception` | `ExceptionEvent.exception` |
  | `featureFlagEvaluation` | `FeatureFlagEvent.featureFlagEvaluation` |
  | `browserWebVital` | `BrowserEvent.browserWebVital` |
  | `azureResourceLog` | `AzureEvent.azureResourceLog` |
  | `genAiEvaluationResult` | `GenAiEvent.genAiEvaluationResult` |
  | `faasInvocationException` | `FaasEvent.faasInvocationException` |
  | `httpClientRequestException` | `HttpEvent.httpClientRequestException` |
  | `httpServerRequestException` | `HttpEvent.httpServerRequestException` |
  | `rpcClientCallException` | `RpcEvent.rpcClientCallException` |
  | `rpcServerCallException` | `RpcEvent.rpcServerCallException` |
  | `genAiClientInferenceOperationDetails` | `GenAiEvent.genAiClientInferenceOperationDetails` |
  | `messagingCreateException` | `MessagingEvent.messagingCreateException` |
  | `messagingSendException` | `MessagingEvent.messagingSendException` |
  | `messagingProcessException` | `MessagingEvent.messagingProcessException` |
  | `messagingReceiveException` | `MessagingEvent.messagingReceiveException` |
  | `messagingSettleException` | `MessagingEvent.messagingSettleException` |

- **Breaking: value-enum renames** (name = PascalCase of the full
  attribute id): `AwsEcsLaunchType` → `AwsEcsLaunchtype`, `HardwareType`
  → `HwType`, `MessagingOperation` → `MessagingOperationType`. `DbSystem`
  still exists for the deprecated `db.system` (now `@Deprecated`); the
  current attribute `db.system.name` gets the new `DbSystemName`.
  Value-enum member ids follow the registry member ids with Dart
  reserved words `$`-escaped, which renames two members:
  `SystemPagingDirection.pageIn` → `in$`, `SystemPagingDirection.pageOut`
  → `out` (emitted values unchanged). The deprecated bare `state`
  attribute's value enum is named `StateValue` to avoid colliding with
  Flutter's `State`.

- **Breaking: legacy `az.*` keys moved out of `Azure`**, the registry
  files deprecated ids by their real prefix, so `Azure.azNamespace` and
  `Azure.azServiceRequestId` are now `Az.azNamespace` and
  `Az.azServiceRequestId` (both `@Deprecated`) in `semconv/az.dart`.
  Deprecated-only legacy roots each get their own file the same way:
  `az.dart`, `net.dart`, `message.dart`, `pool.dart`, and `other.dart`
  (the dotless legacy `state` key).

- `HttpHeaderAttribute` now extends `OTelSemantic`, so request/response
  header template attributes can be used directly as keys in
  `attributesFromSemanticMap` / `attributesOf`.

### Added

- Full attribute-registry coverage ([#52](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/52)): 24 namespaces that were never
  modeled, including the `app.*` namespace and `app` entity from the
  issue, `App`, `Aspnetcore`, `Cpu`, `Cpython`, `Disk`, `Dotnet`,
  `Go`, `Jsonrpc`, `Jvm`, `Linux`, `Mainframe`, `Mcp`, `Nfs`,
  `Nodejs`, `OncRpc`, `Openai`, `Openshift`, `Oracle` (`oracle.db.*`,
  release candidate), `OracleCloud`, `Pprof`, `SecurityRule`, `Signalr`,
  `V8js`, `Zos`, plus complete member sets for every previously
  partial namespace.
- **Entity enums** ([#52](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/52)): `<Ns>Entity` enums for all 64 registry
  entities (24 namespaces), each member carrying the entity type string
  plus `identifying` / `descriptive` lists wired to the attribute-key
  enums, e.g. `AppEntity.app` identifies by `App.appBuildId`. New
  `OTelEntity` interface in `semantics_base.dart`.
- 14 new metric namespaces (`aspnetcore`, `azure`, `cpu`, `cpython`,
  `dotnet`, `go`, `hw`, `jvm`, `kestrel`, `nfs`, `nodejs`, `openshift`,
  `signalr`, `v8js`) alongside the regenerated 15.
- `OTelSemanticIntValue` for int-valued registry value enums
  (`cpython.gc.generation`, `rpc.grpc.status_code`).
- `SemconvRegistry`, a generated index of every semconv enum
  (`allAttributeEnums`, `allValueEnums`, `allIntValueEnums`,
  `allMetricEnums`, `allEventEnums`, `allEntityEnums`) plus the pinned
  registry version/commit. Powers package-wide invariant tests
  (duplicate-key detection, key-format checks).
- Every non-stable enum member now carries a `Stability:` doc line
  (`development`, `release_candidate`, `alpha`, `experimental`), and
  every registry-deprecated attribute carries `@Deprecated` with the
  registry's replacement guidance.
- `tool/semconv/generate.sh` + checked-in Weaver templates
  (`tool/semconv/templates/registry/dart[_test]/`), pinned to the same
  `otel/weaver:v0.24.2` container digest the semantic-conventions repo
  pins. Also generates audit tests asserting every key, value, metric,
  event, and entity against the registry, plus source audits for
  `@Deprecated`/`Stability:` annotations.

- `NonRecordingSpan` and `OTelAPI.nonRecordingSpan(SpanContext)`, the
  spec's "Wrapping a SpanContext in a Span" operation: the wrapped
  context is returned unchanged, `isRecording` is `false`, and all other
  operations are no-ops ([#54](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/54)).
- **Global `TextMapPropagator`**, `OTelAPI.textMapPropagator` getter/setter,
  implementing the spec's Global Propagators requirement: "The OpenTelemetry
  API MUST provide a way to obtain a propagator for each supported Propagator
  type" (`TextMapPropagator` being the single supported type today). The
  global is non-generic (`TextMapPropagator<dynamic, dynamic>`) and, like
  every other API object, routed through `OTelFactory`, so a replacement
  factory can substitute its own implementation. Isolate-local;
  `OTelAPI.reset()` restores the no-op default ([#55](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/55)).
- `OTelAPI.compositePropagator` / `OTelFactory.compositePropagator`,
  factory-routed construction for `CompositePropagator`, previously the
  only instantiable API object built by direct construction; its public
  constructor is now private (**Breaking**, construct via the factory)
  ([#55](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/55)).
- **`NoopTextMapPropagator`**, the default value of the global, satisfying
  "The OpenTelemetry API MUST use no-op propagators unless explicitly
  configured otherwise": `inject` writes nothing and `extract` returns the
  passed `Context` unchanged ([#55](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/55)).

### Deprecated

- **All vendor/RUM enums**. They are not OpenTelemetry semantic
  conventions and will be removed from this package (future home: the
  Flutter RUM layer). Moved to `semantics/rum.dart`, names/keys/members
  unchanged: `AppLifecycleStates`, `AppLifecycleSemantics`,
  `AppStartType`, `AppInfoSemantics`, `DeviceSemantics`,
  `BatterySemantics`, `NavigationSemantics`, `InteractionType`,
  `InteractionSemantics`, `PerformanceSemantics`, `ErrorSemantics`,
  `NetworkSemantics`, `RumSessionView`, `NavigationAction`,
  `LifecycleState`.
- **All of `GenAi`**, the `gen_ai.*` conventions moved upstream to
  [semantic-conventions-genai](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-genai)
  and are deprecated in the core registry; every member is annotated
  accordingly.
- Registry-deprecated attributes that previously looked current are now
  `@Deprecated`, e.g. `Db.dbSystem`/`dbConnectionString`/`dbUser`/
  `dbName`/`dbStatement`/`dbOperation`, `Deployment.deploymentEnvironment`,
  `Otel.otelLibraryName`/`otelLibraryVersion`, `Enduser.*`,
  `EventAttributes.eventName`, `Code.codeNamespace`,
  `FeatureFlag.featureFlagVariant`, the legacy `net.*`/`az.*`/`http.*`
  keys, and the deprecated `DbSystem` value enum, plus every other
  `deprecated:` entry in the registry.

### Removed

- Members that do not exist in the attribute registry (not even as
  deprecated):

  | Removed | Use instead |
  | --- | --- |
  | `Http.connectionState` | `Http.httpConnectionState` (was a duplicate key) |
  | `Database.dbClientConnectionUsedState` | `Db.dbClientConnectionState` |
  | `Messaging.messagingDestination` | `Messaging.messagingDestinationName` |
  | `Messaging.messagingDestinationKind` | removed from the spec, no replacement |
  | `Messaging.messagingTempDestination` | `Messaging.messagingDestinationTemporary` |
  | `Messaging.messagingProtocol` | `Network.networkProtocolName` |
  | `Messaging.messagingProtocolVersion` | `Network.networkProtocolVersion` |
  | `Elasticsearch.elasticsearchClusterName` | `Db.dbNamespace` |
  | `Elasticsearch.elasticsearchNodeVersion` | removed, no replacement |
  | `User.userSession` | `Session.sessionId` |
  | `ComputeUnit.containerImageTag` | `ContainerAttributes.containerImageTags` |
  | `General.telemetryAutoVersion` | `Telemetry.telemetryDistroVersion` |
  | `System.systemDiskIoDirection` | `Disk.diskIoDirection` |
  | `AppInfoSemantics` vendor keys as semconv | official identity is `App.appBuildId` / `Artifact.*` |
- Value-enum members that do not exist in the registry:
  `TelemetrySdkLanguage.dart` (**note:** `dart` is missing from the
  registry's `telemetry.sdk.language` well-known values. An upstream
  semconv gap; SDKs should keep emitting the literal `dart`),
  `CloudPlatform.herokuDyno`, `NetworkConnectionType.mobile`,
  `ProfileFrameType.java`/`nodejs`/`python`, and
  `SystemMemoryState.slabReclaimable`/`slabUnreclaimable` (slab states
  moved upstream to `system.memory.linux.slab.state`).
- `Version` enum, `schema.url` is not a registry attribute; schema URLs
  belong on providers/`InstrumentationScope`.
- `General`, `SemanticEvent`, and the duplicate `GenAI` enum (see the
  rename/split tables above).
- `genAiSpanName()`, not a convention; compose
  `'<operation> <model>'` directly.

### Fixed

- **Wire format, emitted attribute keys change** ([#52](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/52)). These fix
  the strings actually emitted, so backends keying on the spec names
  will now match:

  | Member (old) | Old emitted key | Correct key |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `Kubernetes.k8sResourcepaceName` | `k8s.Resourcepace.name` | `K8s.k8sNamespaceName` → `k8s.namespace.name` ([#52](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/52)) |
  | `SourceCode.codeResourcepace` | `code.Resourcepace` | `Code.codeNamespace` → `code.namespace` (#50; itself deprecated → `code.function.name`) |
  | `Hardware.*` (7 members) | `hardware.*` | `Hw.*` → `hw.*` |
  | `FeatureFlag.featureFlagProviderName` | `feature_flag.provider_name` | same identifier, now `feature_flag.provider.name` |
  | `CloudPlatform.azureVm`/`azureAks`/`azureFunctions`/`azureAppService`/`azureOpenshift`/`azureContainerApps`/`azureContainerInstances` | `azure_vm` etc. | same identifiers, now the registry's dotted values `azure.vm`, `azure.aks`, `azure.functions`, `azure.app_service`, `azure.openshift`, `azure.container_apps`, `azure.container_instances` |
  | `GenAiTokenType.completion` | `completion` | same identifier (`@Deprecated`), now emits `output`; new member `GenAiTokenType.output` |

- **Breaking:** With only the API installed (no SDK), `startSpan`/`createSpan`
  now follow trace/api.md's "Behavior of the API in the absence of an
  installed SDK": the returned span is non-recording (`isRecording` is
  `false` and every mutating operation is a no-op) and carries the
  `SpanContext` from the parent `Context`. Explicit or implicit.
  Unchanged; when the context has no span, it carries an empty
  `SpanContext` (all-zero trace/span IDs, unsampled flags). Previously
  the API minted random valid IDs and returned recording spans ([#54](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/54)).
  SDK span creation is unaffected: the no-op behavior applies only when
  the installed factory `isAPIFactory`.
- **`Baggage` now follows the spec for values, names, and no-SDK use.**
  Per the Baggage API spec, values are any valid UTF-8 string. The empty
  string is accepted (previously `ArgumentError`) and survives `Set`/`Get`
  and both `fromJson` paths (previously dropped). Invalid (empty) names are
  ignored with a warning instead of throwing. `copyWith` / `copyWithout` /
  `copyWithBaggage` work without an installed SDK (previously `StateError`),
  per "The Baggage API MUST be fully functional in the absence of an
  installed SDK."
- **`TraceState.put` / `remove` never throw.** Per the trace API spec,
  mutating operations validate input and "MUST NOT return `TraceState`
  containing invalid data" while following the error-handling guidelines.
  Invalid keys/values are now ignored with a warning (previously
  `ArgumentError`), and both operations work without an installed SDK
  (previously `StateError`).
- **Provider accessors use safe defaults instead of throwing.** Per the
  trace API spec, an invalid name must return "a working Tracer
  implementation... as a fallback rather than returning null or throwing an
  exception": `OTelAPI.tracerProvider('')` / `meterProvider('')` /
  `loggerProvider('')` now warn and return the global default (previously
  `ArgumentError`), and `getTracer` / `getMeter` / `getLogger` after
  provider shutdown warn and return a no-op instance (previously
  `StateError`).

## [1.0.0-beta.9] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- `OTelAPI.instrumentationScope()` recursed into itself when called before
  initialization, causing an immediate `StackOverflowError`; it now lazily
  installs the no-op API factory like the other accessors ([#32](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/32)). Thanks
  @kevmoo.
- `OTelAPI.tracer()` and `OTelAPI.logger()` threw a null-check error before
  initialization instead of lazily installing the no-op API factory ([#32](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/32)).
- `TraceState.fromString` / `fromMap` / `empty`, `SpanContext.fromJson`, and
  `Baggage.fromJson` threw `StateError('Call initialize() first.')` instead
  of lazily installing the no-op API factory, `fromString` parses the W3C
  `tracestate` header (a propagator path) and the `fromJson`s run in fresh
  isolates during deserialization, both classic pre-init calls ([#34](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/34)).
- `OTelAPI.tracerProviders()` / `meterProviders()` / `loggerProviders()`
  read OTelAPI's private factory cache instead of the global factory, so
  providers of a factory installed by an SDK were invisible until some
  OTelAPI accessor ran ([#34](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/34)).
- `OTelAPI.attributesFromMap`, `Attributes.of`, and `Map.toAttributes()` no
  longer bypass the factory via the static `attrsFromMap` "cheat" (obsolete
  since the beta.8 lazy-install lifecycle); a factory that overrides
  `attributesFromMap` is now respected on all three paths ([#34](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/34)).
- `TraceState` multi-tenant `tracestate` keys (`tenant-id@system-id`) now
  match the W3C Trace Context key grammar: a `tenant-id` may start with a
  digit, and `tenant-id`/`system-id` are length-capped (241/14 chars).
  Previously a digit-leading tenant was rejected and over-long ids
  accepted ([#38](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/38)).

## [1.0.0-beta.8] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- **`OTelFactory.isAPIFactory`**, identifies the API's auto-installed no-op
  factory. Defaults to `false` on `OTelFactory`; `OTelAPIFactory` overrides it
  to `true`. SDK factories (which extend `OTelAPIFactory`) must override it to
  return `false`. Lets SDK initialization replace the spec-mandated no-op API
  factory installed when API code runs first, instead of relying on
  `runtimeType` checks (see dartastic_opentelemetry #50 / PR #53).

### Fixed
- `Context.root` / `Context.current` (and other Context APIs) threw
  `StateError('Call initialize() first.')` when accessed before
  `OTelAPI.initialize()`, violating the OTel spec requirement that the API
  operate as a no-op without an SDK installed. They now lazily install the
  No-Op API factory, matching `OTelAPI`'s existing behavior. Thanks
  @benjaben.
- `Context` re-reads the global factory on every access instead of keeping
  the first one it saw, so a factory installed later (e.g. by an SDK's
  `initialize()`) replaces a no-op cached before initialization.
- `OTelAPI.initialize()` now replaces an installed no-op API factory
  (`isAPIFactory == true`) instead of throwing, so API use before
  initialization (e.g. `Context.current`) no longer blocks explicit
  initialization. **Behavior change:** re-initializing over a no-op API
  factory replaces it and applies the new configuration; only a real
  (non-API) factory still triggers the initialize-once `StateError`.

## [1.0.0-beta.7] - 2026-05-18

## [1.0.0-beta.6] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- `OTelAPI.attributesOf<E extends OTelSemantic>(Map<E, Object>)`, a
  shorthand-friendly counterpart to `attributesFromSemanticMap`.
  Parameterized on a single concrete semconv enum [E], so Dart 3.10
  static dot-shorthand can drop the prefix at the call site:

  ```dart
  // Today and forever:
  OTelAPI.attributesOf<Http>({
    Http.requestMethod: 'GET',
    Http.responseStatusCode: 200,
  });

  // With Dart 3.10+ static dot-shorthand enabled:
  OTelAPI.attributesOf<Http>({
    .requestMethod: 'GET',
    .responseStatusCode: 200,
  });
  ```

  `attributesFromSemanticMap` stays the right call site when you need to
  mix multiple semconv enums or your own `OTelSemantic`-implementing
  enums in one map.

- New top-level `User` enum in `semantics.dart` covering the OTel-spec
  `user.*` keys: `userId`, `userEmail`, `userFullName`, `userName`,
  `userRoles`, `userSession`. Replaces the previous `UserSemantics`
  enum in `ui_semantics.dart`.

- New top-level `Session` enum in `semantics.dart` covering the OTel-spec
  `session.*` keys: `sessionId`, `sessionPreviousId`. Spec-only subset
  of the previous `SessionViewSemantics`.

- **Spec-derived metric-name enums** in new `semantic_metrics.dart`.
  Covers every metric in the OTel attribute registry except the
  language-runtime namespaces (`jvm.*`, `go.*`, `nodejs.*`,
  `cpython.*`, `v8js.*`, `kestrel.*`, `aspnetcore.*`, `signalr.*`,
  `openshift.*`, `nfs.*`, Dart apps don't emit those). Generated by
  parsing the OTel `model/*/metrics.yaml` files, so name / instrument
  kind / unit string travel together:

  ```dart
  final metric = HttpMetric.serverRequestDuration;
  metric.name;        // 'http.server.request.duration'
  metric.instrument;  // SemanticInstrument.histogram
  metric.unit;        // 's'
  ```

  Enums (15): `CicdMetric`, `ContainerMetric`, `DbMetric`,
  `DnsMetric`, `FaasMetric`, `GenAiMetric`, `HttpMetric`, `K8sMetric`,
  `McpMetric`, `MessagingMetric`, `OtelMetric`, `ProcessMetric`,
  `RpcMetric`, `SystemMetric`, `VcsMetric`. New `OTelMetric` interface
  unifies them; new `SemanticInstrument` enum names the four OTel
  instrument kinds.

- **Spec event-name enum** in new `semantic_events.dart`, all 16
  spec-defined event names (`exception`, `feature_flag.evaluation`,
  `browser.web_vital`, `gen_ai.client.inference.operation.details`,
  the per-protocol `*.exception` events for HTTP/RPC/messaging/FaaS,
  plus `azure.resource.log`). `SemanticEvent` exposes a `name`
  getter; `OTelEvent` interface for switching.

### Changed
- **Breaking:** Dropped the `Resource` suffix from semconv-enum names where
  it didn't conflict with a built-in Dart / Flutter / common-package type.
  `HttpResource.requestMethod` is now `Http.requestMethod`,
  `UrlResource.urlFull` is now `Url.urlFull`, etc.. A straight find-and-
  replace migration for ~60 enums. Migration: replace `XResource` →
  `X` for every enum below.

  **Kept** the `Resource` suffix on five enums to avoid name clashes with
  common types:

  | Enum             | Conflicts with             |
  | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
  | `ErrorResource`  | `dart:core` `Error`         |
  | `ExceptionResource` | `dart:core` `Exception`  |
  | `FileResource`   | `dart:io` `File`            |
  | `ProcessResource` | `dart:io` `Process`        |
  | `ServerResource` | `package:grpc` `Server`     |
  | `EventResource`  | `package:web` `Event`       |

  All other 60+ enums dropped the suffix: `Client`, `Cloud`,
  `ComputeUnit`, `ComputeInstance`, `Database`, `Deployment`, `Device`,
  `Environment`, `FeatureFlag`, `GenAI`, `General`, `GraphQL`, `Host`,
  `Http`, `Kubernetes`, `Messaging`, `Network`, `OperatingSystem`,
  `RPC`, `Url`, `Service`, `SourceCode`, `TelemetryDistro`,
  `TelemetrySDK`, `UserAgent`, `Version`, plus all 33 new enums in this
  release (`Android`, `Artifact`, `Aws`, `Azure`, `Browser`, `Cassandra`,
  `Cicd`, `CloudEvents`, `Cloudfoundry`, `Code`, `Destination`, `Dns`,
  `Elasticsearch`, `Enduser`, `Faas`, `Gcp`, `Geo`, `Hardware`,
  `Heroku`, `Ios`, `Log`, `Oci`, `Opentracing`, `Otel`, `Peer`,
  `Profile`, `Source`, `System`, `Test`, `Thread`, `Tls`, `Vcs`,
  `Webengine`).

- **Breaking, file restructure.** `lib/src/api/semantics/resource_semantics.dart`
  → `lib/src/api/semantics/semantics.dart` (the new consolidated home
  for the `OTelSemantic` interface and every attribute-key enum);
  `lib/src/api/semantics/resource_values.dart` →
  `lib/src/api/semantics/semantic_values.dart`. The previous standalone
  `semantics.dart` (interface only) is deleted; its content moved to
  the top of the renamed file. Consumers using the package barrel
  (`package:dartastic_opentelemetry_api/dartastic_opentelemetry_api.dart`)
  are unaffected. Direct `src/api/semantics/...` imports need the
  new paths.

- **Breaking, `UserSemantics` removed.** Use the new `User` enum in
  `semantics.dart` instead. Migration: `UserSemantics.userId` →
  `User.userId`, etc.

- **Breaking, `SessionViewSemantics` split.** OTel-spec keys
  (`session.id`, `session.previous_id`) → `Session` in `semantics.dart`.
  Datadog/Dynatrace-style non-spec RUM keys (`session_id` underscored,
  `session.start`, `session.duration`, `view.*`, `action.count`,
  `user_satisfaction_score`) → new `RumSessionView` enum in
  `ui_semantics.dart`. `ui_semantics.dart` is now strictly the home
  for Flutter / RUM non-spec conventions.

### Added
- **Typed value-set enums**, a new `semantic_values.dart` file exposes
  enums for the 35+ OTel attributes whose spec entry defines a closed
  set of valid string values. Each value enum exposes its on-wire
  string via a `.value` getter and implements `OTelSemanticValue` for
  future polymorphic helpers. Highlights:

  - `CloudProvider`, `CloudPlatform`, `FaasInvokedProvider`,
    `FaasTrigger`
  - `HostArch`, `OsType`
  - `HttpRequestMethod`, `HttpConnectionState`
  - `NetworkType`, `NetworkTransport`, `NetworkConnectionType`,
    `NetworkIoDirection`
  - `DbSystem`, `DbClientConnectionState`, `CassandraConsistencyLevel`,
    `AzureCosmosdbConnectionMode`, `AzureCosmosdbConsistencyLevel`
  - `MessagingSystem`, `MessagingOperation`
  - `RpcSystem`, `RpcMessageType`, `GraphqlOperationType`
  - `OpentracingRefType`, `OtelStatusCode`, `OtelSpanSamplingResult`,
    `TelemetrySdkLanguage`
  - `SystemCpuState`, `SystemMemoryState`, `SystemFilesystemState`,
    `SystemFilesystemType`, `SystemPagingDirection`,
    `SystemPagingState`, `SystemPagingType`, `SystemProcessStatus`,
    `DiskIoDirection`, `LogIostream`
  - `IosAppState`, `AndroidAppState`
  - `AwsEcsLaunchType`
  - `CicdPipelineRunState`, `CicdPipelineTaskType`, `CicdWorkerState`
  - `HardwareType`, `TlsProtocolName`
  - `VcsChangeState`, `VcsLineChangeType`, `VcsRefType`
  - `TestCaseResultStatus`, `TestSuiteRunStatus`
  - `ProfileFrameType`
  - `GenAiOperationName`, `GenAiSystem`, `GenAiTokenType`
  - `ContainerCpuState`, `ProcessContextSwitchType`,
    `ProcessPagingFaultType`

  Usage:

  ```dart
  OTelAPI.attributesFromSemanticMap({
    Database.dbSystemName: DbSystem.postgresql.value,
    Cloud.cloudProvider:   CloudProvider.gcp.value,
    Network.networkTransport: NetworkTransport.quic.value,
  });
  ```

- **Comprehensive semconv-enum coverage of the OTel
  [attribute registry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/).**
  Every top-level registry namespace that wasn't already represented
  now has a typed enum. Consumers can keep using raw strings for
  app-specific keys, but for spec-defined attributes there is now a
  typed-enum entry, making typos at the call site a compile error.

  New enums (33):

  - `AndroidResource`, `android.os.api_level`, `android.app.state`,
    `android.state`
  - `ArtifactResource`, software-artifact / supply-chain
    (`artifact.attestation.*`, `artifact.hash`, `artifact.purl`,
    `artifact.version`, etc.)
  - `AwsResource`, ECS / EKS / Lambda / S3 / CloudWatch Logs /
    DynamoDB attributes (`aws.ecs.*`, `aws.eks.cluster.arn`,
    `aws.lambda.invoked_arn`, `aws.s3.*`, `aws.dynamodb.*`,
    `aws.log.*`, `aws.request_id`)
  - `AzureResource`, `azure.client.id`, `azure.cosmosdb.*`, plus the
    legacy `az.namespace` / `az.service_request_id` keys still emitted
    by some SDKs
  - `BrowserResource`, `browser.brands`, `browser.language`,

## [1.0.0-beta.5] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Pluggable `TimeProvider` for span timestamps.** New abstraction with three pieces:
  - `TimeProvider` (interface) and `SystemTimeProvider` (default, `DateTime.now`), `lib/src/util/time_provider.dart`.
  - `WebTimeProvider`, `window.performance.now()` + `timeOrigin` for sub-millisecond span timestamps on web. Lives in `lib/src/util/web_time_provider.dart` as a conditional facade (`web_time_provider_web.dart` on Dart-on-JS / Wasm; `web_time_provider_stub.dart` throws on native).
  - `defaultTimeProvider`, platform-aware constant exported from `lib/src/util/default_time_provider.dart`. Native targets resolve to `SystemTimeProvider`; web targets to `WebTimeProvider`. Selected at compile time via `dart.library.js_interop`, the modern Wasm-compatible check.

  Plumbed through `APITracerProvider.timeProvider` → `APITracer.timeProvider` → `APISpan._timeProvider` so span starts, ends, and events all source their timestamps from the same clock. `APISpan.addEventNow` and `addEvents(Map)` now route through the span's `_timeProvider` rather than the static `OTelFactory.spanEventNow` shortcut, which was hardcoded to `DateTime.now` and silently dropped sub-millisecond precision when the provider was a `WebTimeProvider`.

  **Why this matters on web.** `DateTime.now()` on Dart-on-JS is millisecond-precision. The underlying source is JS `Date.now()`, and `microsecondsSinceEpoch` returns `millisecondsSinceEpoch × 1000` (the lower three digits are always zero, regardless of the Int64 storage type used by OTLP). `WebTimeProvider` routes through the browser performance API: ~5µs nominal precision, browser-coarsened to ~100µs as a Spectre mitigation, still 10 to 200× better than `Date.now()`. Native targets are unaffected and stay at `DateTime.now`'s 1µs floor.

  **Auto-default on web.** Web users do not have to opt in. Constructing an `APITracerProvider` on a web target automatically gets `WebTimeProvider` via `defaultTimeProvider`. To override (e.g., a fake clock in tests), assign `tracerProvider.timeProvider = customProvider`.
### Changed
- README and the API example now use `OTelAPI.attributesFromSemanticMap({Enum.value: ...})` for typed-enum-keyed attribute maps in place of `OTelAPI.attributesFromMap({Enum.value.key: ...})` / `Attributes.of({Enum.value.key: ...})` / `<String, Object>{...}.toAttributes()`. The shorter form drops the `.key` accessor on every entry while keeping the typed-enum-key principle. Mixing different semconv enum types in one map is fine. The param is `Map<OTelSemantic, Object>` and every semconv enum implements `OTelSemantic`. No API surface change; `attributesFromSemanticMap` has existed since beta-era.

## [1.0.0-beta.4] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- `OTelAPI.loggerProviders()`. Returns the global default `APILoggerProvider` plus any named providers added via `OTelAPI.addLoggerProvider(name)`. Parallel to the existing `tracerProviders()` and `meterProviders()`. Backed by a new `OTelFactory.getLoggerProviders()` so SDK implementations get the same enumeration. Lets `OTel.shutdown()` in the SDK iterate over named LoggerProviders the way it already does for tracer / meter providers, without this, `OTel.addLoggerProvider(name)` consumers had to remember to shut each one down manually.

## [1.0.0-beta.3] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- **Breaking:** `ServiceResource.serviceResourcepace` (key `service.Resourcepace`) was a mangled find/replace artifact (`Name` → `Resource` accidentally hit `serviceNamespace`). Restored the correct OTel semconv entry: `ServiceResource.serviceNamespace` with key `service.namespace`. Migration: replace `ServiceResource.serviceResourcepace` with `ServiceResource.serviceNamespace`.

## [1.0.0-beta.2] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- `DatabaseResource.dbCollectionName` (`db.collection.name`), current OTel semconv key, replaces the deprecated `db.sql.table`.
- `DatabaseResource.dbResponseReturnedRows` (`db.response.returned_rows`), current OTel semconv key for the row count returned by a database operation.
- `UserSemantics.userRoles` (`user.roles`), current OTel semconv key, an array of roles assigned to a user.

### Changed
- README and example renamed the placeholder `AppAttribute` enum to `ExampleAttribute` (so readers can't blindly copy the name) and dropped the redundant `app.` prefix from invented demo keys. Where current OTel semconv keys exist, the example now uses the API's typed enums (e.g. `DatabaseResource.dbCollectionName`, `UserSemantics.userRoles`) instead of an app-defined fallback.

### Removed
- **Breaking:** `UserSemantics.userRole` (singular `user.role`). The singular form is an anti-pattern. Users typically have multiple roles. Use `UserSemantics.userRoles` (`user.roles`) and pass a `List<String>` instead.

## [1.0.0-beta.1] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed
- `Context.runIsolate()` now marks the deserialized `SpanContext` as `isRemote = true` on the receiving side. Previously the parent isolate's local SpanContext (with `isRemote = false`) was restored verbatim, so `tracer.startSpan` in the new isolate fell into the "no parent" branch and produced a fresh root span instead of a child of the parent. This now matches the W3C trace-context-from-HTTP semantic, a SpanContext that crossed a process or isolate boundary is treated as remote and parented correctly.

## [1.0.0-beta] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- (Thank you to Kevin Moore [@kevmoo](https://github.com/kevmoo)) `Context.run()` and `Context.runSync()`. Zone-based implicit context propagation. These are the spec-aligned way to attach a context for a scope of execution and ensure it propagates correctly across `await`s and async callbacks.
- (Thank you to Kevin Moore [@kevmoo](https://github.com/kevmoo)) `isTransferable` flag on `ContextKey` (default `false`) to opt custom keys into cross-isolate transfer via `Context.runIsolate()`.
- `ServerResource` and `UrlResource` semantic resource enums.

### Changed
- **Breaking:** `tracer.startSpan()` no longer automatically activates the span in the current context, aligning with the OpenTelemetry specification. Use `tracer.withSpan` / `withSpanAsync` (or `Context.runSync` / `Context.run`) to make a span active for a scope.
- **Breaking:** `Context.currentWithBaggage()` is now pure. It returns a Context with Baggage but no longer mutates `Context.current`. Pair the returned Context with `runSync` / `run` if you need it active.
- **Breaking:** Custom values stored via `ContextKey` are no longer transferred across isolate boundaries by default. Pass `isTransferable: true` when creating the key to opt in. Built-in `Baggage` and `SpanContext` continue to transfer unconditionally.
- `APITracer.withSpan()` and `withSpanAsync()` now use Zone-based context propagation (`Context.runSync` / `Context.run`) for correct behavior across async boundaries (no-op implementation only).
- README and example updated to demonstrate Zone-based context management.

### Deprecated
- The static `Context.current` setter. Setting it does not propagate across `Zone`s, which produces incorrect context inside async callbacks. Use `Context.run()` or `Context.runSync()` instead.

### Fixed
- `APITracer.createSpan()` now correctly inherits parent spans from the provided `context` parameter or `Context.current`. Previously these were ignored.
- `Context.runIsolate()` now serializes the specific Context instance it was called on, not the global `Context.current`.
- `Context.runIsolate()` no longer mutates the parent isolate's `_currentContext` on return. Eliminates a case where Zone-bound context could leak into the parent's static field.
- `nowAsNanos()` no longer loses precision on JS. The 64-bit wrap now happens before the multiplication by 1000.
